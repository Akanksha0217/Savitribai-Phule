      Savitribai Phule (pronunciation‚ìò; 3 January 1831 ‚Äì 10 March 1897) was an
      Indian educator, <b>social reformer</b>, and poet, widely regarded as the <u>first
      female teacher of modern India</u>.Along with her husband, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyotirao_Phule">Jyotiba Phule</a>,
      she played a pivotal role in advancing women's rights and education in
      Maharashtra, leaving a legacy that continues to influence social reform
      movements across India. She is also considered a pioneer of India's
      feminist movement. She worked to abolish discrimination and the unfair
      treatment of people based on caste and gender. Savitribai Phule and her
      husband were trailblazers in women's education in India.In 1848,
      they established their first school for girls at the residence of
      Tatyasaheb Bhide, known as <b>Bhide Wada</b> in Pune.

      Savitribai‚Äôs career was marked by her relentless efforts in advancing
      education for girls and marginalized communities. By 1851, she and
      Jyotirao managed three girls‚Äô schools in Pune with around 150 students.
      They opened a total of 18 schools, alongside initiatives such as<b> "Mahila
      Seva Mandal"</b> in 1851 to promote women's rights and the <b>"Balhatya
      Pratibandhak Griha"</b>, an infanticide prevention center for widows in 1853.
      Savitribai‚Äôs literary contributions include Kavya Phule (1854) and Bavan
      Kashi Subhodh Ratnakar (1892). She died of bubonic plague in 1897. Today
      her legacy as the </b>‚ÄúMother of Modern Education in India‚Äù</b> endures,
      commemorated through memorials, institutional names, and cultural
      representations.

    <h3><u>Early life</u></h3>
    <p>Savitribai was illiterate at the time of her marriage. Her husband educated her, as well as his cousin sister, Sagunabai Shirsagar, at their home while working on their farm. Once she completed her primary education with <b>Jyothirao</b>, she continued her studies under the guidance of her friends, <b>Sakharam Yeshwant Paranjpe and Keshav Shivram Bhavalkar</b>. In 1846‚Äì47, she passed the third and fourth-year examinations in an English school, and in the same year, she helped Sagunabai establish a school for marginalized communities in Maharwada.[18] She enrolled herself in two teachers' training programs; the first was at an institution run by an American missionary, Cynthia Farrar, in Ahmednagar, and the second course was at a Normal School in Pune. Savitribai was become India's first trained female teacher and headmistress</p>
    <h4>Personal life</h4>
    <p>Savitribai and Jyotirao had no children of their own. It is said that they adopted Yashawantrao, who was the son of a Brahmin widow. However, there is no primary evidence currently available to support this.It is said that when Yashwant was ready for marriage, it was difficult to find a suitable partner because he was born to a widow. Hence, Savitribai is believed to have arranged his marriage to the daughter of <b></b>Dynoba Sasane</b>, a worker in her organization, in February 1889</p>
